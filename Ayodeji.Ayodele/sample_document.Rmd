# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# EDA{.tabset}

## Summary


```{r cars, comment=""}
summary(cars)
```

## Visualizations

> Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, dpi=95}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(reticulate)
```


```{python}
x = 42*2
```


```{r}
#retrieve the value from python object
py$x/2
```

```{r}
# assign a value to python object
py$y <- seq(1,50, by = 0.01)
```


```{python}
print(y[1:10]);
```

## Python plot

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot([0,2,1,4])
plt.show()
```

```{r}
library(JuliaCall)
```


> Some Julia Codes

```{julia}
a = sqrt(49)

typeof(a)
```


## Map

```{r}
library(leaflet)

leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% 
  setView(-93.65, 42.0285, zoom = 17) %>% 
  addPopups(
    -93.65, 42.0285,
    'Here is the <b>Department of Statistics</b>, ISU'
  )
```
